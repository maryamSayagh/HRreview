Using statistical models to improve decision-making and performance within organizations is now a traditional
practice. Yet many analytics outcomes get buried once they reach operations. While operational analytics
aims to bridge this gap, aims to connect insight to action, it often lacks the mechanisms to adapt to human
intervention. The failure of these operations – based on current statistics – shows that this time the problem is
not in the methodology and business model, but rather in trust misalignment between the artificial and the
conscious.

Human oversight in Automated Decision-Making Systems (ADMS) doesn’t always present a flaw. In fact,
historical failures, such as automation attempts in healthcare during the 1960s and ’70s, highlight the risks
of removing human oversight. Although solutions and new systems were put into action, studies show that
override rates can range from 40 % to over 70 % [3]. Then we find ourselves in the same old dilemma of balancing
the power between humans and AI.

Most dashboards stop at generating recommendations; they do not track whether decisions were followed
or overridden, or why. While we are not observing the transition from analytics to operations, failure is a
promised result. This absence of feedback mechanisms limits system learning, trust calibration, and alignment
between model logic and user behavior.

Override decisions follow observable patterns influenced by trust, confidence, urgency, and explanation
clarity—these can be modeled probabilistically. Probabilistic models treat override not as noise but as a behavioral
signal; therefore they provide measures and distributions, as well as uncertainty levels. This enables a feedback
loop that helps the system adapt to justified overrides and adjusts either the predictive model or the human
interface.

In this contribution, we suggest a HOVER (Human Override-aware Validation and Enrichment Response)
framework integrating override behavior into the operational analytics pipeline within a feedback-aware
architecture, which will decrease resource waste caused by unactionable insights and recommendations.
